This project was made to monitor OEE for machines

This webapp works with an Android app for the user. It has the ability to be used via a browser but I haven't fully
tested this.

Machine activity is recorded as an "activity" in the database. An activity is created by the Kafka consumer whenever a
machine changes state, and ended when the machine changes state again.
Additional detail to the activity is handled by the flask app, and is added to the same entry in the activity table.
This additional detail is in the form of "activity code" e.g. UP = uptime, NO = No Operator, stored in the activity
code table.
A "Job" is a single unique instance of a user working on a machine. When the user stops working, that job ends and
every activity during the job's runtime is given a reference back to that job (only for the job's machine)


POSTing to /run_schedule causes the machines schedules to be run for that day, and saved to the scheduled_activity
table. It can be ran on a different date by giving it the argument date=dd-mm-yy
e.g. curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/run_schedule?date=18-08-19
