This project was made to monitor OEE for machines

This project uses Kafka to receive an event every time a machine changes state. This Kafka message can be sent either
manually by an operator through the flask app or automatically by the machine. Two web addresses are provided depending
on whether the data is being recorded manually or automatically.
Machine activity is recorded as an "activity" in the database. An activity is created by the Kafka consumer whenever a
machine changes state, and ended when the machine changes state again.
Kafka only deals with the machine being on or off. This is recorded as "machine_state"
Additional detail to the activity is handled by the flask app, and is added to the same entry in the activity table.
This additional detail is in the form of "activity code" e.g. UP = uptime, NO = No Operator, stored in the activity
code table.
A "Job" is a single unique instance of a user working on a machine. When the user stops working, that job ends and
every activity during the job's runtime is given a reference back to that job (only for the job's machine)
